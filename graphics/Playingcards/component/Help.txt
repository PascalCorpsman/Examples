TPlayingCard Component
======================

Properties
==========

Show property - TShowOption

  One of three values (soFace, soBack and soTool) determining
  which type of image is to be displayed.

  soFace: The card is face up, and displays the image determined by
    the FaceIndex or Value and Suit properties.

  soBack: The card is face down, and displays one of the images in the
    global back image list, as identified by the BackIndex property.

  soTool: The card displays an image from the global tool image list,
    as identified by the ToolIndex property.

FaceIndex property - Integer;

  A value between 0 and 53 inclusive, identifying which playing card
  face image to display when Show = soFace. 

  0 represents the red Joker, and 53 the black joker.
  1 to 13 represent ace, two, three .. king of clubs; 14..26 are
  diamonds; 27 to 39 are hearts; 40 to 52 are spades.

Value property - Integer

  A value between 0 and 13 inclusive, identifying which playing card
  face value to display when Show = soFace.

  0 represents the joker of the same color as the suit identified by
  the Suit property. 1..13 represents ace, two, three .. king.

Suit property - Integer

  A value between 0 and 3 inclusive, identifying which playing card
  suit to display when Show = soFace.

  0 = Clubs, 1 = Diamonds, 2 = Hearts, 3 = Spades.

BackIndex property - Integer

  A value 0 or above which identifies the image in the global list
  of back image bitmaps, to be displayed when Show = soBack.
  This index must be between 0 and BackCount-1 inclusive.

ToolIndex property - Integer

  A value 0 or above which identifies the image in the global list
  of tool image bitmaps, to be displayed when Show = soTool.
  This index must be between 0 and ToolCount-1 inclusive.

BackCount property - Integer, read only

  Indicates the number of images available to all TPlayingCard
  components in the application, for use as back images. Each time
  the AddBack method is called, BackCount increments by one.

ToolCount property - Integer, read only

  Indicates the number of images available to all TPlayingCard
  components in the application, for use as tool images. Each time
  the AddTool method is called, ToolCount increments by one.

Selected property - Boolean

  Determines whether the card should be display highlighted or not


Methods
=======

function AddTool(Bitmap: TBitmap): Integer;

  Adds 'Bitmap' to the list of bitmap images available to all
  TPlayingCard components, and returns an index to that image, to
  be used with the ToolIndex property.
  The TBitmap object passed to the function becomes owned by the
  cards unit, and must not be freed by the user - it shall be freed
  when the application terminates. It cannot be removed from the list
  either, so the user should be conservative with the use of AddTool

function AddBack(Bitmap: TBitmap): Integer;

  Adds 'Bitmap' to the list of bitmap images available to all
  TPlayingCard components, and returns an index to that image, to
  be used with the ToolIndex property.
  The TBitmap object passed to the function becomes owned by the
  cards unit, and must not be freed by the user - it shall be freed
  when the application terminates. It cannot be removed from the list
  either, so the user should be conservative with the use of AddBack

  The methods AddTool and and AddBack are provided for flexibility
  only - use the global functions AddCardTool, AddCardBack,
  LoadCardTool and LoadCardBack instead, when your application starts.
  Add all of the bitmap images required by your TPlayingCard 
  components at application start-up. You must load them before
  the BackIndex and ToolIndex properties can refer to them.

function LoadTool(const Filename: string): Integer;

  Similar to AddTool, this will load a bitmap file for use as a
  tool image, and return the Index to that image. Again the bitmap
  will not be freed until the application terminates.

function LoadBack(const Filename: string): Integer;

  Similar to AddBack, this will load a bitmap file for use as a
  back image, and return the Index to that image. Again the bitmap
  will not be freed until the application terminates.

Global Functions
================

function AddCardTool(Bitmap: TBitmap): Integer;

  Identical to the 'AddTool' method of TPlayingCard


function LoadCardTool(const Filename: string): Integer;

  Identical to the 'LoadTool' method of TPlayingCard


function GetCardTool(Index: Integer): TBitmap;

  Retrieves the TBitmap object at position Index in the tool image list.
  Use the Draw method of TCanvas with this function to display the raw
  bitmap on a canvas.

 
function GetCardToolCount: Integer;

  Returns the number of TBitmap objects that can be indexed using
  the property ToolIndex. Returns the same value as the ToolCount
  property.

function AddCardBack(Bitmap: TBitmap): Integer;

  Identical to the 'AddTool' method of TPlayingCard


function LoadCardBack(const Filename: string): Integer;

  Identical to the 'LoadBack' method of TPlayingCard


function GetCardBack(Index: Integer): TBitmap;

  Returns the TBitmap object at position Index in the back image list.
  Use the Draw method of TCanvas with this function to display the raw
  bitmap on a canvas.


function GetCardBackCount: Integer;

  Returns the number of TBitmap objects that can be indexed using
  the property BackIndex. Returns the same value as the BackCount
  property.


procedure DrawCardFace(Index: Integer; Canvas: TCanvas; CRect: TRect; Invert: Boolean);
procedure DrawCardBack(Index: Integer; Canvas: TCanvas; CRect: TRect; Invert: Boolean);
procedure DrawCardTool(Index: Integer; Canvas: TCanvas; CRect: TRect; Invert: Boolean);

  Draws the face, back or tool image (specified by Index) inside the
  rectangle CRect on Canvas. If Invert is True, the card image is
  draw in it's highlighted state.
