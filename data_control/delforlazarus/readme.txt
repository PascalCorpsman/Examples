Known problems:
        (1)
        Compiler {$IFDEF} + {$ELSE} directives may be nested to 3 levels and break
        into blocks of code. After the third nested level the right indentation
        is not guaranteed.

        (2)
        After some options (align, adding line breaks) the indentation might
        be not correct. Rerunning DelFor can fix the problems.

        (3)
        It is tried to indent function directives after function declarations.
        In some cases this does not happen.

        (4)
        After formatting the positions of breakpoints and bookmarks are not changed 
        (all bookmarks are moved and stacked at the end of the file) breakpoints 
        are removed) If someone knows how to get and set the locations of these points
        I would be happy to hear from you.
