# Lazcomment

This is a component to be used at designtime (only inside the IDE, during editing sourcecode). If you write your own FreePascal IDE (or a application that can show and format source code), than for shure you can also include the component into this application as well.

The purpose of this component is to toggle between "//" and no line comment by pressing "CTRL + #"

Features:

- Comment / uncomment code

### Installation
Open the lazcomment.lpk via the IDE and hit the install option (when requested to recompile the IDE's code, click YES).
